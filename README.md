# Mind-Magic-Game
This is a simple MIND MAGIC GAME developed in C++. To start with, you have to consider a number between 1 to 100 in your mind. Do not tell that number to anyone. Then you have been given several cards. Based on that you have to tell whether a particular number is present in those cards or not. Based on the information gathered, program can tell which number you have selected! It can read the number in your mind..

# How to play this game?
This game is a console based game. To play this game, first you need to download the **Mind-Magic-Game.cpp** file in your system. Then run the file using any C++ compiler which you have. You can also use several online compilers which have console based inputs. Now, start playing!

First of all when you will start the game you can see some instructions printed on your screen. Read them carefully. Program will ask you to read the instructions or to play the game directly. You can read the instructions by hitting the command "i". Read the instructions carefully before starting the game. Now once you have read all the instructions, type "p" to start playing the game.

Then you have to consider any number **Between 0 to 100** and you should keep it secret. Do not tell it to anyone. Once you are ready with your number type "y" to proceed. After this few cards will appear on your screen. You have to check whether the number which you have selected is there in the card flashing on your screen. If the number is there, type "y", otherwise type "n".

There will be exactly seven cards in front of your screen. After the seventh card, program would be able to identify the number which you have selected.. Finally, you would be amazed that the number printed on your computer screen, is nothing but what you had chosen!!!

# Logic Behind the Game
This program works on the simple principle of binary numbers. If you don't know about them, first check them out. Any number can be represented using the powers of two. For example, 67 can be represented as 64+2+1. Using this simple principle seven cards are formed suitably. Thus, 67 will be present in card of 64, card of 2 and card of 1. It will not be present in any other cards..That is as simple as that!!
